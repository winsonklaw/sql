She plays well with the other dog, and she is not hyper but has energy to go on nice long walks and to play as much as you want.    She is potty trained and crate trained, and she is also able to stay uncrated in the house without being destructive.    Clementine can be fearful and she really benefits from a calm approach and positive reinforcement.   She has been nervous when people come over and will bark a little, but she calms down and warms up very quickly to guests.

My name is Ramsey and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by an Animal Control Officer on June 3, 2025. <p/><p/>I weigh 48.0 lbs, but I am quite underweight. When at a healthy weight I would be considered a ""large breed"" dog.<p/><p/>I am very treat motivated and will ""sit"" for them, but watch your fingers because I am not the most gentle when taking them yet!<p/><p/>I am unsure of new things and people so I am looking for a patient family who understands I am a work in progress! Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home without younger children (fast movements and loud noises startle me). I went to a foster home briefly and they said I appear to be fully potty trained and crate trained! I also do well with other dogs who have a full contact playstyle and like to wrestle. I am also great on leash! <p/><p/>I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",Dog,Pit Bull,729616

When I go to my new home it is important to be patient with me and allow me time to acclimate to my new environment at my own speed. It is best to keep me in a smaller, quiet room, with my food, bed, and litterbox until I am comfortable and confident enough to start exploring the rest of my home.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and spirited kitten. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>You can visit me at the Pet Adoption Center on weekdays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. <p/><p/>The Pet Adoption Center is located at 21615 64th Ave S, Kent, WA 98032.<p/><p/>Come and visit me today, I'd love to go home with you!<p/>",Cat,Domestic Longhair,732585

I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space! Cleaning my cage and grooming are important for me too! <p/><p/>I am a gentle soul who likes to take things slow. <p/><p/>",Rabbit Sh,Rabbit Sh,733145

It is best to keep me in a smaller, quiet room, with my food, bed, and litterbox until I am comfortable and confident enough to start exploring the rest of my home.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>You can visit me at the Pet Adoption Center on weekdays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. <p/><p/>The Pet Adoption Center is located at 21615 64th Ave S, Kent, WA 98032.<p/><p/>Come and visit me today, I'd love to go home with you!<p/>",Cat,Domestic Shorthair,733250
